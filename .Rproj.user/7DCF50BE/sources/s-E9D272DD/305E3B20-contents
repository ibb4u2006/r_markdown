# R Markdown
## Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see [This Link](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the _Knit_ button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including Equations
You can also add equations, such as

* $f(x) = e^x$
* $f^′(x)=x^2(a_1+a_2)$
* $A=πρ^2$

## R Scripting

```{r scripting, echo=FALSE}
# install.packages("data.table")
library(data.table)

  
chunk <- fread("data/data_PRT.csv")
str(chunk)
```


## Plot histogram
```{r histogram, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
tidy <- melt(chunk)
ggplot(data = tidy, aes(value)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid( ID ~ variable, scales = 'free_y')
```
